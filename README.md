🏗️ Java Learning Journey — Bridgelabz (ID: 2415500282)

Welcome to my Java Training Repository, where I’ve documented my weekly learning progress throughout the Bridgelabz Training Program.
This repo reflects my step-by-step growth — from learning basic syntax to implementing advanced Java features like OOPs, Lambdas, and Exception Handling.

📘 Overview

This repository is structured into multiple branches, each dedicated to a key Java module.
Each branch explores new concepts with practical examples and projects.

🪄 Branch	🧩 Key Topics
java-core	Data types, variables, loops, arrays, strings, logic building
java-oops	Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation
packages-in-java	Packages, imports, and modular code organization
wrapper-class	Wrapper classes, Autoboxing, Unboxing, type conversion
functional-interface	Functional interfaces, default/static methods, and lambda usage
error-and-exception	Exception hierarchy, try-catch, custom exceptions
lambda-expression	Modern coding using lambdas and functional programming
